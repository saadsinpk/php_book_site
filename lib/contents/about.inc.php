				<h4>Our path to knowledge</h4>
				<p>Libraries have always played an important role in the Islamic world, ensuring that learning and books were not exclusive to a select few but accessible to all.<br><br>The MuslimConnect Library is a small effort to continue that tradition and make available a collection of free written literature about Islam and Muslims.</p>

		<p>Reading books is food for the mind and soul, instilling a sense of openness and perspective that can help readers find peace and build understanding, tolerance and respect for others.</p>
		<p>Our mission is not only to offer access to books, information and lifelong learning opportunities for the Muslim community, but to serve and benefit every member of society who wants to seek knowledge on the various genres of Islamic literature and sciences.</p>
		<p>Our Library travels on a rotating roster to different locations in Melbourne every week, including community centres, local non-profit organizations, festivals, events and more!</p>
